Forest Fire Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbours and Linear Regression Project Summary This is a repository created for two machine learning models, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Linear Regression, developed for the estimation of forest fires. The project offers an example of how the algorithms could be used in solving a real-world problem like the occurrences of forest fires from different factors of the environmental set-up.

Dataset
In the given project, the data set contains several environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, which are usually major predictors in case of a forest fire. The preprocessing of data includes treating missing values and scaling for the better performance of models.

Models
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points by considering similarities with their nearest neighbors. Here, the KNN will be implemented to classify areas as either in fire-risk or not, based on historical data.

Hyperparameters:

Number of Neighbors - k
Distance Metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
Evaluation Metrics:
